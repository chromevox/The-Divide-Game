## Welcome to the official website for the Divide text-based game.

_There exists a space between kingdoms, between worlds, and between minds._

_When we are afraid, we call it no man's land. We cover it in barbed wire and warn children to stay away. It is a place of shadows._

_When we are brave, we call it the divide. We build bridges across it and teach children to reach across it. It is a crossing._

_In the air, floating amidst cloud and light, Altia looks down upon the war-torn surface with wariness. Deep within the stone of the planet and submerged under the vast oceans, Beia closes its walls against the surface out of fear._

_No man's land. The Divide._

### What is the Divide?

The Divide is an open-world text-based roleplaying game made with the Evennia MUD codebase. It can be played single-player or players can set up private servers to play with friends. Unlike typical MUD games where players are often restricted to a single character, the Divide places an emphasis on playing multiple characters simultaneously and interacting between characters. Progressing the story quests allows players to team up with interesting NPCs and even step into their shoes occasionally. Players can choose to leap into the fray of the Divide's world conflicts, hunt for treasure and collect rare artifacts, team up with NPCs and player characters to hunt down powerful equipment, or simply relax with a wide variety of mini-games such as gardening or fishing.
